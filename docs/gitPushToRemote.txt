Perfect! Here’s a **one-page Quick Reference Checklist** you can keep handy for any future GitHub 403 headaches on macOS:

# GitHub 403 Quick Fix Checklist (macOS)

### Symptom

```text
remote: Permission denied to <repo>.git
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/...': The requested URL returned error: 403
```

GitHub thinks you’re the wrong user.

---

### Step 1: Check Git identity

```bash
git config --get user.name
git config --get user.email
```

✅ Should match your GitHub account.

**If wrong:**

```bash
git config --global user.name "YourGitHubUsername"
git config --global user.email "YourGitHubEmail"
```

---

### Step 2: Reset the remote (optional, if repo URL changed)

```bash
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/YourRepo.git
```

---

### Step 3: Delete cached credentials (Keychain)

1. Open **Keychain Access** (`Cmd + Space` → type *Keychain Access*).
2. Search `github.com`.
3. Look for entries like:

   * `Github – https://api.github.com` → usually correct.
   * `github.com – Internet password` → often the culprit.
4. Delete the wrong one(s) (especially the old username).

> Deleting forces Git to ask for login again.

---

### Step 4: Push with correct credentials

```bash
git push origin master
```

* **Username:** your GitHub username
* **Password:** Personal Access Token (PAT)

macOS Keychain will save the new credential automatically.

---

### Step 5: Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) (if needed)

1. Go to [GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
2. Click **Generate new token (classic)**.
3. Give it a note (e.g., “MacBook Git Push”), set expiration.
4. Select **repo** scope.
5. Generate → copy token.
6. Use it as **password** when prompted during push.

---

### ✅ Optional tips

* Switch to SSH to avoid repeated HTTPS login issues:

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:YourGitHubUsername/YourRepo.git
```

* Always confirm which Keychain entry is tied to the wrong account before deleting.

This checklist basically compresses your entire fix into a **“follow these steps if 403 appears”** guide.

If you want, I can also make a **tiny flowchart version** — visually showing: *403 error → check identity → clear Keychain → PAT → push* — super quick to reference.

Do you want me to make that visual flowchart too?
