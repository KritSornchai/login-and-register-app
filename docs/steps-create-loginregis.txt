Steps that I used to create login/register form:
I used “Context Engineering”

Step 0:  so called first prompt
I first wrote a draft of my objective about how the web app should look, its functionalities
Step 1: used ai to reshape the prompt
I used ai to reshape my first draft to make it the standard second draft. Ex: 
Use standard practices inside the prompt
Step 2: get to work
Use the ai created prompt and tell it to create the login and register web app
Step 3: follow ai steps
Create files according to what ai tells us
Step 4. Working login and register forms
Once the web application worked we can proceed to step 5.
Step 5:
Reverse engineer the files and directories created by the ai. We can use ai to help reverse engineer too
Step 6: craft a simpler way to clone this Web app
Make it simple for even others to exactly copy and paste this web application in a few steps
Step 7.
Once others can do it, explain how it all works,
