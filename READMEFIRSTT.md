Let's look back at the roadmap. You have now completed:
✅ User Authentication (Register & Login)
✅ Admin Dashboard with full CRUD
✅ Persistent Sessions (express-session)
✅ Password Security (bcrypt hashing)
✅ Professional Database (PostgreSQL)

Your foundation is incredibly strong. Now is the perfect time to focus on the structure of your code and prepare it for more complex features and eventual deployment.

Here is a revised roadmap focusing on the absolute best practices for a project at this stage.
Tier 1: Professional Structure & Security (Highly Recommended Next Steps)
These are "housekeeping" tasks that professional developers do to ensure their code is maintainable, scalable, and secure. It's much easier to do this now than later when the project is bigger.

1A. Refactor Your Code into a Modular Structure
Why it's a best practice: Your server.js file is becoming a "monolith"—one giant file that does everything (database connection, middleware, API routes, page serving). As the app grows, this becomes very hard to read and maintain. The professional standard is Separation of Concerns.
What you will do:
Create a routes folder.
Inside, create authRoutes.js (for /register, /login) and adminRoutes.js (for /api/users, etc.).
Move all the route logic from server.js into these new files.
In server.js, you will simply import and use these route files.
What you will learn: The single most important skill for organizing a backend application. This makes your code infinitely cleaner, easier to debug, and ready to scale.

1B. Use Environment Variables for Secrets
Why it's a best practice: Your database credentials (user, password, port) and your session secret are hardcoded in server.js. If you ever push this code to a public GitHub repository, you will leak your secrets to the world. This is a critical security flaw.
What you will do:
Install the dotenv package (npm install dotenv).
Create a new file named .env in your project's root directory.
Move all your secrets (DB password, session secret) into this file.
Create a .gitignore file and add .env to it to ensure Git never tracks your secrets.
Update server.js to load these variables from the .env file.
What you will learn: The industry-standard method for managing secret keys and configuration. This is a non-negotiable skill for professional development.

Tier 2: Major User-Facing Features

Now that your code is clean and secure, you can confidently build new features.
2A. Create a Protected User Dashboard
Why it's a best practice: The application isn't complete until regular users have a reason to log in. This feature closes the loop on the user experience.
What you will do:
Create a dashboard.html page.
Update your /login route to create a user session (e.g., req.session.user = { id: user.id, username: user.username }).
Create a requireLogin middleware to protect the /dashboard route.
On the dashboard, display a personalized welcome message.
Bonus: Add a form where a user can change their own password.
What you will learn: How to manage multiple user roles and sessions, and how to build out the core purpose of a user-centric application.

Tier 3: The Final Step to a Live Application

3A. Deploy to the Cloud
Why it's a best practice: The ultimate goal of a web application is to be live on the internet for others to use.
What you will do:
Choose a hosting platform with a free tier that supports Node.js and PostgreSQL (e.g., Render is excellent for this).
Follow their guides to connect your GitHub repository.
Configure your production database and set your environment variables on the platform.
Deploy the application and get a live, public URL.
What you will learn: The complete end-to-end development lifecycle, from local coding to a live production environment.
My Recommended Path for You
Refactor into a Modular Structure first. Clean your house before you add more furniture. This will make every subsequent step easier.
Use Environment Variables next. This is a quick but critically important security step that should be done before adding any new features.
Then, create the Protected User Dashboard. With a clean and secure codebase, building this major feature will be a much better experience.
Finally, Deploy to the Cloud. This is the capstone that brings everything you've learned together.
You are in a fantastic position. Which of these professional practices would you like to tackle first?
